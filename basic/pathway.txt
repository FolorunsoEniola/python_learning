You're on a great path toward DevOps already — with your CCNA-level networking knowledge, Linux fundamentals, some Git, Ansible, and learning Python, you’ve got many of the foundational pieces.

✅ Here's a Recommended DevOps Roadmap for You (Next Steps)


---

1. Get Strong on Linux + Bash Scripting

Why: Every DevOps role demands deep Linux command-line skills and basic shell scripting.

Focus:

File permissions, systemd, cron jobs

grep, awk, sed, cut, xargs, find

Bash scripting (variables, loops, functions)



📘 Resource:
LinuxCommand.org – great for learning Bash from scratch
📘 The Missing Semester of Your CS Education – Shell & Tools


---

2. Get Confident in Git & GitHub (Version Control)

Why: Every project uses Git. Learn branching, merging, resolving conflicts, Git hooks, etc.

Focus:

Gitflow (feature branches, hotfix, release)

Rebase vs Merge

GitHub Actions (later for CI/CD)



📘 Resource:

📘 Oh My Git! game (fun & interactive)


---

3. Master Ansible + YAML

Why: Ansible is a beginner-friendly config management tool with no agent required. Your earlier work gives you a head start.

Next Focus:

Roles, variables, templates, inventories

Ansible Vault (for secrets)

Dynamic Inventory & Real-world Playbooks



📘 Resource:
🔧 Ansible for Beginners by Jeff Geerling (YouTube)
📘 Official Ansible Docs


---

4. Docker (Containers)

Why: DevOps = containers. Docker is core for packaging, testing, and deploying apps.

Focus:

Dockerfile, docker-compose

Building, tagging, pushing images

Volumes, networks

Debugging containers



📘 Resource:
🐳 Docker Mastery (Udemy) by Bret Fisher
📘 Play with Docker (free playground)


---

5. Learn Kubernetes (After Docker)

Why: Most DevOps deployments use Kubernetes (K8s). You don’t need to master it yet, but learn the basics.

Focus:

Pods, Deployments, Services

ConfigMaps, Secrets

kubectl commands

Helm basics



📘 Resource:
☸ Kubernetes for Beginners (FreeCodeCamp video)
📘 Katacoda Kubernetes Playground
📘 Kubernetes by Example


---

6. CI/CD Pipelines

Why: Automating tests and deployments is core to DevOps.

Focus:

GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

Jenkins (optional)

Pipeline concepts: stages, jobs, triggers



📘 Resource:
🚀 GitHub Actions: Beginner to Guru (YouTube)
📘 GitLab CI/CD Docs


---

7. Cloud Services (Start with AWS or Azure)

Why: Most companies deploy in the cloud. Even basic cloud skills are valuable.

Focus:

AWS EC2, S3, IAM, VPC basics

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform (later)



📘 Resource:
☁ AWS Free Tier Setup Guide
📘 AWS Cloud Practitioner Free Course (FreeCodeCamp)
📘 Learn AWS by Doing (Build apps)


---

8. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – Terraform

Why: Automating cloud provisioning is powerful. Ansible is config management, Terraform is provisioning.

Focus:

Providers, resources, modules

terraform plan, apply, destroy



📘 Resource:
🌍 Terraform on HashiCorp Learn
📘 Complete Terraform Course (YouTube)


---

🛠 What You Can Build (Projects)

1. Ansible Lab – Deploy a LAMP stack or Kubernetes cluster with Ansible


2. Dockerized App – Create a Python Flask API and dockerize it


3. GitHub Actions CI/CD – Automate testing and deployment of your app


4. Kubernetes Cluster (minikube) – Deploy your Docker app in K8s locally


5. IaC Project – Provision AWS EC2 + S3 using Terraform




---

💡 Bonus Tools (As You Grow)

Monitoring/Logging: Prometheus + Grafana, ELK Stack

Secrets Management: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager

Service Mesh: Istio (for later)

Certs to Consider:

AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner or Solutions Architect

Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)

HashiCorp Terraform Associate
